# List of errors

There should be a zero here for Born-Haber cycles

There are electrons missing here. Electrons should be produced from IE

First EA should be exothermic

This should be first IE + second IE. There are cases where you will use 2 x first IE (e.g. Na in sodium oxide)

BE for oxygen gas gives you two oxygen atoms. In fact this should be half BE
